- blocked on WASM addon working = need to be able to have the `addon` checks work to be able to instantiate `Battle`
-  esbuild chokes on `inject: ['import {h, Fragment} from \'dom\'']`, despite `"dom": ["src/tools/display/dom"]` in the tsconfig paths, and changing it to a relative or absolute import etc does absolutely nothing. i worry it has to do with the jsx `preserve` option in the tsconfig, but removing the preserve causes the `react/jsx-runtime` to get injected and theres appears to be no way to remove that. just adding an unused `import` of the `dom` directly in `ui.tsx` gets pruned because fuck you, and hacking it in with a `.replace` is probably going to get cucked by mangling
