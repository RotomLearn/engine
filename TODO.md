- blocked on WASM addon working = need to be able to have the `addon` checks work to be able to instantiate `Battle`
-  esbuild chokes on `inject: ['import {h, Fragment} from \'dom\'']`, despite `"dom": ["src/tools/display/dom"]` in the tsconfig paths, and changing it to a relative or absolute import etc does absolutely nothing. i worry it has to do with the jsx `preserve` option in the tsconfig, but removing the preserve causes the `react/jsx-runtime` to get injected and theres appears to be no way to remove that. just adding an unused `import` of the `dom` directly in `ui.tsx` gets pruned because fuck you, and hacking it in with a `.replace` is probably going to get cucked by mangling
- you can't only load dex data for the species present in the battle bc that's not robust to forme changes, and you can't just use the moves present in pokemons move slots bc fucking Metronome screws you. arguably you *could* be clever and only include all move data if a mon *does* have metronome (or pedantically, just moves procable by metronome), and only include additional species *if* formechanges are possible.
- besides that pruning, the data is still further optimizable. JSOn means you need to use quotes strings, but you should be able to drop that by just using an object literal like how `@pkmn/img` manages. can go even further by turning everything into arrays, though might be excessive
- `@pkmn/img` data needs to be pruned through `adaptable` (guess it shouldnt be removed after all?) - only include mons in the gen, or if we're pruning to just battle species then only those. and only include data for the `SpriteGen` in question
